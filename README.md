# Creality Ender 3 Firmware build

Build system to compile Marlin for Creality Ender3 in a docker container. Ideal for CI systems, but can also be used locally. 

Uses the docker image from https://github.com/shukriadams/docker-platformio

## How to

To build in docker container use

    sh ./build-in-docker

If you have platformio installed locally (f.egs if running in Vagrant) use

    chmod +x build.sh
    ./build.sh

The compiled firmware is Marlin\.pio\build\STM32F103RET6_creality/*.bin. Copy this to an SDcard, put the card in your Ender3 and start it.
